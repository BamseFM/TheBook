# TheBook
Just a book project I probably never finish! Feel free to help.

Quick rules:

1. All characters and elements of the environment (animals, plants, biomes etc) should be descirbed with a file per character, per animal and per plant. Descirbing it, and some backstory. This makes it easier to create context and richer backstories when needed.

2. Take the projects seriously and write decent :)
